Ah, what a headache...

You end up opening your eyes, just to find yourself in a smelly and dark room. 
You start looking around for a little bit, and you just see that you woke up from a bed
There's no idea or clue about what happened last night and how you got there
All you know is that you went to a friend's birthday party
Then you drank lots of Margaritas, and you have no idea what happened afterwards.
Are you trapped inside this place? How can you get out? 

A phone is ringing......
